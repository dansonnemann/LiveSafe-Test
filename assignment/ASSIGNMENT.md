## Assignment

The purpose of this is simply to get a small sample of some of your work, and have something
concrete to discuss next time we see you.

We respect and appreciate your time: please do not spend more than a couple hours of your time on this.
Feel free to turn in what you have at the end of that time, and provide a brief explanation of what
you would do next, given more time.

## Task

Hacker News feed has been created. The feed cards are currently just spitting out stringified JSON
and need to be correctly formatted.

There is also a bug in the application where the filter field isn't working correctly. Use the unit
tests to help you find and fix the bug and update the unit tests to reflect the updates.

reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

directory.

## Running unit tests
